# Error Surface ğŸŒŠâ†’ğŸ’§â†’ğŸ§Šâ†’ğŸ’ 

Measures when errors can occur in the system lifecycle.

## The Scale

### ğŸŒŠ Ocean (Errors Cascade Unpredictably)
One failure triggers system-wide effects. Errors spread like waves.

**Examples**:
- Shared mutable global state
- Null pointer exceptions cascading through object graphs
- Race conditions in concurrent systems

**Historical**: NASA Mars Climate Orbiter - unit confusion cascaded through systems.

**Why it's ğŸŒŠ**: One error creates tsunamis throughout your system.

### ğŸ’§ Liquid (Runtime Errors, Handled)
Errors occur during execution but are contained.

**Examples**:
- `Result<T, Error>` types in Rust
- Try-catch blocks with proper error handling
- Validation at function boundaries

**Why it's ğŸ’§**: Errors flow but through defined channels.

### ğŸ§Š Ice (Startup/Initialization Errors)
Errors caught when system boots or components initialize.

**Examples**:
- Dependency injection validation
- Configuration schema checking at startup
- Database connection verification

**Why it's ğŸ§Š**: Errors freeze the system before it can do damage.

### ğŸ’  Crystal (Compile/Parse-Time Prevention)
Invalid states cannot be constructed. Types make errors impossible.

**Examples**:
- `divide :: Int -> NonZeroInt -> Int` (division by zero impossible)
- State machines encoded in types
- Parse-don't-validate patterns

**Historical**: Therac-25 radiation overdoses - type safety could have prevented patient deaths.

**Why it's ğŸ’ **: Errors literally cannot exist in the crystal structure.

## Assessment Questions

1. **Can one error crash unrelated parts?** (Yes â†’ ğŸŒŠ)
2. **Do errors occur during normal operation?** (Yes â†’ ğŸ’§)
3. **Are errors caught at startup only?** (Yes â†’ ğŸ§Š)
4. **Are errors impossible by construction?** (Yes â†’ ğŸ’ )

## The Progression

```
ğŸŒŠ try { doEverything() } catch { ??? }
   â†“
ğŸ’§ Result.map(validate).flatMap(process).getOrElse(default)
   â†“
ğŸ§Š @Component class Service(required: Dependencies) // Fails at boot
   â†“
ğŸ’  newtype Email = Email String -- Can only construct valid emails
```

## Domain Priorities

- **Human lives at stake**: ğŸ’  is non-negotiable
- **Financial systems**: At least ğŸ§Š, prefer ğŸ’ 
- **Experimentation/prototypes**: ğŸ’§ might suffice
- **Never acceptable**: ğŸŒŠ in production
